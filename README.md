Enginerdery is a blog for the plain English dissemination of engineering research. This blog is available to all engineering researchers who are willing to write about their recently published papers and provide a description of the results written to be accessible to a broad audience. Posts should be written to be jargon free and understandable to persons without a background in engineering.
