Enginerdery is a project of [openENGR](http://www.openengr.com) and a blog which provides an outlet for engineering researchers and scholars to share their work with a broad audience. Too often the research community becomes insular and neglectful of the public audience in our research dissemination. Today is it more important than ever that the work conducted in tucked away research labs and funded largely through public money is accessible to the general public. Accessibility is more than just [freely available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access); to be accessible, the general public must also be able to understand the work. This means eliminating confusing jargon and focusing instead on the _what happened?_ and the _who cares?_ questions.

Researchers and scholars across all of engineering are invited to submit a plain English write up of their recent paper or other published work written with the general public in mind.

Please see our [submission instructions](http://www.enginerdery.org/submit/) to get started.
